## Contributions

Contributions of all kinds, including corrections, additions, improvements, documentation, and translations, are very welcome!

We hope you'll join and help, in small ways or large.
Here are a few notes before you jump in!

### Style

- Stay close to the existing style of the document when possible.
- Remember to focus on **brevity**, **specificity**, and **utility**.
- Avoid long explanations and instead prefer links to resources.

## Code

If you would like to fix a bug or implement a feature, please fork the repository and create a Pull Request.

Before you start any Pull Request, it's recommended that you create an issue to discuss first if you have any doubts about requirement or implementation.
That way you can be sure that the maintainer(s) agree on what to change and how, and you can hopefully get a quick merge afterwards.
Also, let the maintainers know that you plan to work on a particular issue so that no one else starts any duplicate work.

Pull Requests can only be merged once all status checks are green.

### Using Issues and Pull Requests


- Follow our template guides when generating an Issue or a PR.
- Please **create and comment on issues freely** to discuss. A lot of the difficulty in accepting PRs is around style and format, and whether changes should be made at all, so rationale or explanations for the change are useful.
- Please **review open issues and pull requests** before submitting a new one, to help reduce duplication.
- To the extent possible, **break up changes into multiple PRs** so they can be approved separately. Large contributions are also welcome, but are harder and slower to approve, as they tend to require discussion or rewriting.

## Translations

Here is the process for maintaining translations, in case you want to add maintenance for some new language:

- This original version and content of the guide is maintained in English.
- *Translations follow the content of the original.* Note this means contributors to a translation must be able to read some English, so that translations do not diverge.
- Each translation has a maintainer to update the translation as the original evolves and to review others' changes. This doesn't require a lot of time, but review by the maintainer is important to maintain quality.
- Prefix PRs and issues with changes to languages if they are for that translation only, e.g. "es: Improve grammar", so maintainers can find them easily.

## Re-requesting a review

Please do not ping your reviewer(s) by mentioning them in a new comment.
Instead, use the re-request review functionality.
Read more about this in the [GitHub docs, Re-requesting a review](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/incorporating-feedback-in-your-pull-request#re-requesting-a-review).
